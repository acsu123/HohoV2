What should I do if I'm getting too many ads while trying to get my key?
If you encounter excessive ads, use **Brave Browser** to complete **3 Linkvertise tasks**, as Lootlabs tasks cannot be performed in Brave. If you continue to experience issues after following all steps and watching the tutorial for your device, consider opting for a premium key.
In Mobile, If ads are obstructing your view, I'd recommend enabling Desktop Mode in Google Chrome by following these steps:
1. Open the three-dot menu in Chrome.
2. Click on **Desktop Site**.
3. This should help in removing the ads.
